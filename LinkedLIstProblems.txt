Find the middle of a given linked list
Given a singly linked list, find the middle of the linked list. For example, if the given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5 then the output should be 3. 
If there are even nodes, then there would be two middle nodes, we need to print the second middle element. 
For example, if the given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6 then the output should be 4. 

Detect loop in a linked list
Given a linked list, check if the linked list has a loop or not. The below diagram shows a linked list with a loop.
