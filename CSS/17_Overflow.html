    <h2>Overflow PROPERTY</h2>
    <p>
      In life there are short straws and writing about a Sensible Rishabh Pant
      innings is one of those short straws. I'm not being ungrateful. A Sensible
      Rishabh Pant innings is still worth more than, say, all of Sir Alastair
      Cook's most un-boring (the laptop is not allowing me to type
      "entertaining") innings. A Sensible Rishabh Pant innings is still more fun
      than an entire career's worth of innings byâ€¦ (no, I'm not going to name
      Dom Sibley, Azhar Ali, Cheteshwar Pujara, Dean Elgar, Kraigg Brathwaite or
      Geoffrey Boycott here).
