Linked list Data Structure

A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node. For example,

Head -> |data|next| -->  |data|next| -->  |data|next| -->  |data|next| -->  |data|next| --> null

Linked lists can be of multiple types: 
singly, 
doubly, and 
circular linked list

Representation of Linked List
Each node consists:
	A data item
	An address of another node
	
class Node {
	int data;
	Node next;
	public Node(int data){
		this.next = null;
		this.data = data;
	}
}

Operations possible..
1. insertion
	Time Complexity -> O(n)
	Space Complexity -> O(n)
2. deletion
	Time Complexity -> O(1)	
	Space Complexity -> O(n)
3. search
	Time Complexity -> O(n)
	Space Complexity -> O(n)
