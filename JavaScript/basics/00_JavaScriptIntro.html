    <h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>
    <p>
      JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the
      client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive
    </p>
    <p>
      Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web
      pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.
    </p>

    <h1>What is JavaScript used for?</h1>
    <p>
      web-based applications and web browsers. But JavaScript is also used
      beyond the Web in software, servers and embedded hardware control
    </p>
