      The over from hell began about half an hour before the close, the ground
      bathed in sunlight a shade of extreme troll: all day absent only to turn
      up when there's barely a day left. It was the 22nd over of an England
      innings that had begun nearly seven hours ago.

      Three breaks for rain meant Mohammed Shami was bowling his 11th
      consecutive over without undue strain. Shami is not the most famous Lala
      in cricket. But with his thinning hair and permanent air of a character
      who has accidentally strolled out from a Netflix series on the badlands of
      Uttar Pradesh, he is a very endearing one.
