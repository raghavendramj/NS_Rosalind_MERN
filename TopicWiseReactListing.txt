		Virtual DOM is not visible on the UI, whereas Real DOM is visible. 
		
Advantages of React

Webpack 
	-> minification/bundling
	
	batch size = 6 
	1 webpage -> 10 stylesheets + 20 script files  = 31 files
	31/6  -> 6 requests
	
	1 webpage + 1 bundled stylesheet + 1 bundled script
	3 files -> 1 batch
	3/6 -> 1 requests
	
	minification shortens a fileâ€™s contents without changing its meaning.
